  The ATC (Air Traffic Controller) provides UI and API access. It is
  responsible for scheduling builds and detecting versions of your resources.

  properties:

properties:
  bind_ip:
    description: |
      IP address on which the ATC should listen for HTTP traffic.
    default: 0.0.0.0

  bind_port:
    description: |
      Port on which the ATC should listen for HTTP traffic.
    default: 8080

  tls_bind_port:
    description: |
      Port on which the ATC should listen for HTTPS traffic.
    default: 4443

  tls_cert:
    description: |
      SSL cert to use for HTTPS.

      If not specified, only HTTP will be enabled.

  tls_key:
    description: |
      SSL private key to use for encrypting HTTPS traffic.

      If not specified, only HTTP will be enabled.

  external_url:
    description: |
      Externally reachable URL of the ATCs. Required for OAuth.

      Typically this is the URL that you as a user would use to reach your CI.
      For multiple ATCs it would go to some sort of load balancer.
    example: https://ci.concourse.ci

  peer_url:
    description: |
      Address used internally to reach the ATC. This will be auto-generated
      using the IP of each ATC VM if not specified.

      Note that this refers to an *individual ATC*, not the whole cluster. This
      property is only useful if you're deploying in a way that cannot
      autodetect its own IP, e.g. a `bosh-init` deployment.

      You should otherwise leave this value blank.
