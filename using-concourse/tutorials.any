It can be hard to learn a new tool without having something you want to
accomplish. These tutorials will at least guide you through particular use
cases to show you how you'd use Concourse in real-world scenarios.

\list{
  \reference{flight-school}: an interactive example of testing and deploying a
  Rails app
}{
  \reference{versioned-s3-artifacts}: a demonstration of how to semantically
  version and publish a product
}{
  \hyperlink{https://github.com/starkandwayne/concourse-tutorial}{Concourse
  Tutorial} by \hyperlink{https://starkandwayne.com/}{Stark & Wayne}, which
  starts simple and iteratively builds into more complex (and realistic)
  examples.

You may also want to just dive right in to some living, breathing Concourse pipelines. These aren't accompanied by documentation explaining them, but it may be useful just to see some real-world use cases:
