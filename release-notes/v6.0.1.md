* Remove `Query` argument from `fly curl` command. 

  When passing curl options as `fly curl <url_path> -- <curl_options>`, the first curl option is parsed as query argument incorrectly, which then causes unexpected curl behaviour. #5366

  With fix in #5371, `<curl_options>` functions as documented and the way to add query params to `fly curl` is more intuitive as following:

  ```
  fly curl <url_path?query_params> -- <curl_options>
  ```
