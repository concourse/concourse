\title{User Roles & Permissions}{user-roles}

\use-plugin{concourse-docs}

Concourse comes with four roles: Concourse Admin, Team Owner, Team Member,
Team Viewer.

\section{
  \title{Concourse Admin}{concourse-admin}

  \italic{Admin} is a special user attribute granted only to
  \reference{team-owner-role}{owners} of the \reference{main-team}.

  Admins have the ability to administrate teams using
  \reference{fly-set-team}, \reference{fly-destroy-team},
  \reference{fly-rename-team}, etc.
}

\section{
  \title{Team Owner role}{team-owner-role}

  Team Owners have read, write and auth management capabilities within the
  scope of their team. For those familiar with Concourse today, the scope of
  allowed actions for a Team Owner is very closely aligned to today’s Concourse
  team member. The new change is that you can no longer rename your own team
  or destroy your own team as an owner.
}

\section{
  \title{Team Member role}{team-member-role}

  Team Member lets users operate within their teams in a read & write fashion;
  but prevents them from changing the auth configurations of their team.
}

\section{
  \title{Team Viewer role}{team-viewer-role}

  Team Viewer gives users "read-only" access to a team. This locks everything
  down, preventing users from doing a \reference{fly-set-pipeline} or
  \reference{fly-intercept}.
