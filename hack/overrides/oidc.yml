# oidc.yml - a docker-compose override that adds a OIDC auth to the stack
#
# Note: due to docker networking, when logging into Concourse, it'll redirect
# you to `http://oidc:9000/auth?client_id=...`. Just change the hostname to be
# `http://localhost:9000/auth?client_id=...` and it'll work just fine.
#
# There are 2 users and 1 group:
# user1@example.com:user1pass;group1
# user2@example.com:user2pass
