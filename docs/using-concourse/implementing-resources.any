\title{Implementing a Resource}{implementing-resources}

A resource type is implemented by a container image with three scripts:

\list{
  \code{/opt/resource/check} for checking for new versions of the resource
}{
  \code{/opt/resource/in} for pulling a version of the resource down
}{
  \code{/opt/resource/out} for idempotently pushing a version up
}

Distributing resource types as containers allows them to package their own
dependencies. For example, the Git resource comes with \code{git} installed.

All resources must implement all three actions, though the actions can just be
no-ops (which still must be correctly implemented as detailed below).

Resources can emit logs to the user by writing to \code{stderr}. ANSI escape
codes (coloring, cursor movement, etc.) will be interpreted properly by the web
UI, so you should make your output pretty.

\section{\code{check}\aux{: Check for new versions.}}{resource-check}{
  A resource type's \code{check} script is invoked to detect new versions of
  the resource. It is given the configured source and current version on stdin,
  and must print the array of new versions, in chronological order, to stdout,
  including the requested version if it's still valid.

  The request body will have the following fields:

  \list{
    \code{source} is an arbitrary JSON object which specifies the location of
    the resource, including any credentials. This is passed verbatim from the
    \reference{configuring-resources}{pipeline configuration}.

    For \code{git} this would be the repo URI, which branch, and a private key
    if necessary.
  }{
    \code{version} is a JSON object with \code{string} fields, used to uniquely
    identify an instance of the resource. For \code{git} this would be a commit
    SHA.

    This will be omitted from the first request, in which case the resource
    should return the current version (\italic{not} every version since the
    resource's inception).
  }

  For example, here's what the input for a \code{git} resource may look like:

  \codeblock{json}{
  \{
    "source": \{
      "uri": "git://some-uri",
      "branch": "develop",
      "private_key": "..."
    \},
    "version": \{ "ref": "61cebf" \}
  \}
  }

  Upon receiving this payload the \code{git} resource would probably do
  something like:

  \codeblock{bash}{
  [ -d /tmp/repo ] || git clone git://some-uri /tmp/repo
  cd /tmp/repo
  git pull && git log 61cbef..HEAD
  }

  Note that it conditionally clones; the container for checking versions is reused
  between checks, so that it can efficiently pull rather than cloning every time.

  And the output, assuming \code{d74e01} is the commit immediately after
  \code{61cbef}:

  \codeblock{json}{
  [
    \{ "ref": "61cbef" \},
    \{ "ref": "d74e01" \},
    \{ "ref": "7154fe" \}
  ]
  }

  The list may be empty, if there are no versions available at the source. If
  the given version is already the latest, an array with that version as the
  sole entry should be listed.

  If your resource is unable to determine which versions are newer then the
  given version (e.g. if it's a git commit that was \code{push -f}ed over),
  then the current version of your resource should be returned (i.e. the new
  \code{HEAD}).
}

\section{\code{in}\aux{: Fetch a given resource.}}{
  The \code{in} script is passed a destination directory as \code{$1}, and
  is given on stdin the configured source and a precise version of the resource
  to fetch.

  The script must fetch the resource and place it in the given directory.

  If the desired resource version is unavailable (for example, if it was
  deleted), the script must error.

  The script must emit the fetched version, and may emit metadata as a list of
  key-value pairs. This data is intended for public consumption and will make it
  upstream, intended to be shown on the build's page.

  The request will contain the following fields:

  \list{
    \code{source} is the same value as passed to \reference{resource-check}.
  }{
    \code{version} is the same type of value passed to
    \reference{resource-check}, and specifies the version to fetch.
  }{
    \code{params} is an arbitrary JSON object passed along verbatim from
    \reference{params} on a \reference{get-step}.
  }

  Example request, in this case for the \code{git} resource:

  \codeblock{json}{
  \{
    "source": \{
      "uri": "git://some-uri",
      "branch": "develop",
      "private_key": "..."
    \},
    "version": \{ "ref": "61cebf" \}
  \}
  }

  Upon receiving this payload the \code{git} resource would probably do
  something like:

  \codeblock{bash}{
  git clone --branch develop git://some-uri $1
  cd $1
  git checkout 61cebf
  }

  And output:

  \codeblock{json}{
  \{
    "version": \{ "ref": "61cebf" \},
    "metadata": [
      \{ "name": "commit", "value": "61cebf" \},
      \{ "name": "author", "value": "Hulk Hogan" \}
    ]
  \}
  }
}

\section{\code{out}\aux{: Update a resource.}}{
  The \code{out} script is called with a path to the directory containing the
  build's full set of sources as the first argument, and is given on stdin the
  configured params and the resource's source configuration.

  The script must emit the resulting version of the resource. For example, the
  \code{git} resource emits the sha of the commit that it just pushed.

  Additionally, the script may emit metadata as a list of key-value pairs. This
  data is intended for public consumption and will make it upstream, intended to
  be shown on the build's page.

  The request will contain the following fields:

  \list{
    \code{source} is the same value as passed to \reference{resource-check}.
  }{
    \code{params} is an arbitrary JSON object passed along verbatim from
    \reference{params} on a \reference{put-step}.
  }

  Example request, in this case for the \code{git} resource:

  \codeblock{json}{
  \{
    "params": \{
      "branch": "develop",
      "repo": "some-repo"
    \},
    "source": \{
      "uri": "git@...",
      "private_key": "..."
    \}
  \}
  }

  Upon receiving this payload the \code{git} resource would probably do something
  like:

  \codeblock{bash}{
  cd $1/some-repo
  git push origin develop
  }

  And output:

  \codeblock{json}{
  \{
    "version": \{ "ref": "61cebf" \},
    "metadata": [
      \{ "name": "commit", "value": "61cebf" \},
      \{ "name": "author", "value": "Mick Foley" \}
    ]
  \}
  }
}

\section{Metadata}{resource-metadata}{
  When used in a \reference{get-step} or a \reference{put-step}, metadata about
  the running build is made available via the following environment variables:

  \definitions{
    \item{\code{$BUILD_ID}}{
      The internal identifier for the build. Right now this is numeric but it
      may become a guid in the future. Treat it as an absolute reference to the
      build.
    }

    \item{\code{$BUILD_NAME}}{
      The build number within the build's job.
    }

    \item{\code{$BUILD_JOB_NAME}}{
      The name of the build's job.
    }

    \item{\code{$BUILD_PIPELINE_NAME}}{
      The pipeline that the build's job lives in.
    }

    \item{\code{$BUILD_TEAM_NAME}}{
      The team that the build belongs to.
    }

    \item{\code{$ATC_EXTERNAL_URL}}{
      The public URL for your ATC; useful for debugging.
    }
  }

  If the build is a one-off, \code{$BUILD_NAME}, \code{$BUILD_JOB_NAME}, and
  \code{$BUILD_PIPELINE_NAME} will not be set.

  None of these variables are available to \code{/check}.

  These variables should be used solely for annotating things with metadata for
  traceability, i.e. for linking to the build in an alert or annotating an
  automated commit so its origin can be discovered.

  They should \italic{not} be used to emulate versioning (e.g. by using the
  increasing build number). They are not provided to \reference{task-step}
  steps to avoid this anti-pattern.
